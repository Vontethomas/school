        <h2>Visionary Leadership</h2>
        <p>In the modern world, visionary leaders are those who exhibit foresight, inspire others, and guide their followers towards a common, often bold, future. One example is <strong>Elon Musk</strong>, whose work in space exploration and electric vehicles exemplifies visionary leadership. His ability to envision a sustainable future and his ambitious approach to technological advancement define him as a visionary leader.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Elon Musk: A Visionary Leader in Technology</h3>
                <p>Elon Musk has accomplished all three stages of visionary leadership as outlined by Mathews (2016). His ability to anticipate future trends and act on them, even when the risks are high, has shaped the electric vehicle industry, as seen with Tesla, and his work with SpaceX, which aims to make human life multi-planetary.</p>

    <!-- Cultural Intelligence Section -->
    <section id="cultural-intelligence">
        <h2>Cultural Intelligence (CQ)</h2>
        <p>Cultural Intelligence (CQ) is the ability to interact effectively with people from different cultures. It consists of cognitive, metacognitive, motivational, and behavioral components. Personally, my current level of CQ is an ongoing journey. I strive to understand and respect cultural differences, though I realize I still need to improve my ability to adapt my behavior when interacting with people from diverse backgrounds.</p>
        <div class="cq-assessment">
            <h3>My Cultural Intelligence Assessment</h3>
            <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Understanding cultural norms and values. <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Sometimes I find it challenging to adjust my communication style in cross-cultural interactions.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Responsible Leadership Section -->
    <section id="responsible-leadership">
        <h2>Responsible Leadership</h2>
        <p>Responsible leadership involves encouraging success through ethical decisions and understanding the broader impact of one's actions. The theory by Voegtlin et al. (2012) outlines various outcomes such as ethical decision-making, stakeholder engagement, and promoting a responsible organizational culture.</p>
        <h3>Key Propositions for Effective Leadership</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Proposition 1: Ethical Decision-Making is vital.</li>
            <li>Proposition 2: Balancing Stakeholder Interests.</li>
            <li>Proposition 3: Embracing Global Standards and Corporate Social Responsibility.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Emotions in Leadership Section -->
    <section id="emotions-leadership">
        <h2>Emotions in Leadership</h2>
        <p>Emotional intelligence is crucial for leaders to foster relationships, build trust, and make effective decisions. Mathews (2016) explains how emotions influence leadership behavior and decision-making. A leader's ability to manage their emotions and understand the emotions of others can make a significant difference in building cohesive teams and driving organizational success.</p>
